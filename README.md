# Jackalope [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope)

A powerful implementation of the [PHPCR API](http://phpcr.github.com).

You can use Jackalope with different storage backends. For now, we support:

* *relational databases* with the DoctrineDBAL backend. Works with any
    database supported by doctrine (mysql, postgres, ...) and has no dependency
    on java or jackrabbit. For the moment, it is less feature complete.
* *Jackrabbit* server backend supports many features and requires you to simply
    install a .jar file for the data store component.

# Preconditions

* libxml version >= 2.7.0 (due to a bug in libxml [http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=36501](http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=36501))
* phpunit >= 3.5 (if you want to run the tests)
* phpunit/DbUnit (if you want to run the Doctrine DBAL Transport tests)

# Installation

    # in your project directory
    git clone git://github.com/jackalope/jackalope.git
    cd jackalope
    git submodule update --init --recursive

*Be sure to run the git submodule command with recursive to get all dependencies of jackalope.*

## Jackalope Jackrabbit

Besides the Jackalope repository, you need the Jackrabbit server component. For instructions, see [Jackalope Wiki](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/wiki/Running-a-jackrabbit-server)
Make sure you have at least the version specified in [the protocol implementation](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/blob/master/src/Jackalope/Transport/Jackrabbit/Client.php#L56)

## Jackalope - Doctrine DBAL

Besides the Jackalope repository, you need [Doctrine DBAL](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal)
(which bundles [Doctrine Common](https://github.com/doctrine/common) too) installed on your machine.

    # in your project directory
    cd lib/vendor
    git clone git://github.com/doctrine/dbal.git doctrine-dbal
    cd doctrine-dbal
    git submodule update --init

## phpunit Tests

If you want to run the tests , please see the [README file in the tests folder](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/blob/master/tests/README.md)**


## Enable the commands

There are a couple of useful commands to interact with the repository.

To use the console, copy cli-config.php.dist to cli-config.php and adjust it
to use jackrabbit or doctrine dbal and configure the connection parameters.
Then you can run the commands from the jackalope directory with ``./bin/phpcr``

NOTE: If you are using PHPCR inside of Symfony, the DoctrinePHPCRBundle
provides the commands inside the normal Symfony console and you don't need to
prepare anything special.

Jackalope specific commands:

* ``jackalope:init:dbal``: Initialize a database for jackalope with the
    Doctrine DBAL transport.
* ``jackalope:run:jackrabbit [--jackrabbit_jar[="..."]] [start|stop|status]``:
    Start and stop the Jackrabbit server

Commands available from the phpcr-utils:

* ``phpcr:workspace:create <name>``: Create the workspace name in the
    configured repository
* ``phpcr:register-node-types --allow-update [cnd-file]``: Register namespaces
    and node types from a "Compact Node Type Definition" .cnd file
* ``phpcr:dump [--sys_nodes[="..."]] [--props[="..."]] [path]``: Show the node
    names under the specified path. If you set sys_nodes=yes you will also see
    system nodes. If you set props=yes you will additionally see all properties
    of the dumped nodes.
* ``phpcr:purge``: Remove all content from the configured repository in the
     configured workspace
* ``phpcr:sql2``: Run a query in the JCR SQL2 language against the repository
    and dump the resulting rows to the console.



# Bootstrapping

Jackalope relies on autoloading and the namespaces and folder structure follow
PSR-0. Either set up your autoloading to find classes in the following folders
or copy the ``autoload.jackrabbit.dist.php`` resp. ``autoload.dbal.dist.php``
file in ``src/`` to ``autoload.php`` and adjust as needed.

If you checked out everything as submodules, the paths will be

* src/
* lib/phpcr/src
* lib/phpcr-utils/src
* lib/phpcr-utils/lib/vendor


## Bootstrapping Jackrabbit

Minimalist sample code to get a PHPCR session with the jackrabbit backend.

    $jackrabbit_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/server/';
    $user       = 'admin';
    $pass       = 'admin';
    $workspace  = 'default'; // to use a non-default workspace, you need to create it first. Until phpcr:workspace:create is supported for jackrabbit, see [test README](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/blob/master/tests/README.md) for instructions.

    $repository = \Jackalope\RepositoryFactoryJackrabbit::getRepository(array('jackalope.jackrabbit_uri' => 'http://localhost:8080/server'));
    $credentials = new SimpleCredentials($user, $pass);
    $session = $repository->login($credentials, $workspace);


## Bootstrapping Doctrine DBAL

For Doctrine DBAL, you additionally need the doctrine repositories autoloaded.
If you checked out as in the above instructions, those paths will be

* lib/vendor/doctrine-dbal/lib
* lib/vendor/doctrine-dbal/lib/vendor/doctrine-common/lib

Then you need to make sure the commands are set up (see above "Enable the
commands") and run

    bin/jackalope jackalope:init:dbal

To initialize jackalope in your application, you do

    $driver   = 'pdo_mysql';
    $host     = 'localhost';
    $user     = 'root';
    $password = '';
    $database = 'jackalope';
    $workspace  = 'default'; // to use a non-default workspace, you need to create it first. Just use the command phpcr:workspace:create

    // Bootstrap Doctrine
    $dbConn = \Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager::getConnection(array(
        'driver'    => $driver,
        'host'      => $host,
        'user'      => $user,
        'password'  => $pass,
        'dbname'    => $database,
    ));

    $repository = \Jackalope\RepositoryFactoryDoctrineDBAL::getRepository(array('jackalope.doctrine_dbal_connection' => $dbConn));
    // dummy credentials, unused
    $credentials = new \PHPCR\SimpleCredentials(null, null);
    $session = $repository->login($credentials, $workspace);


# Usage

The entry point is to create the repository factory. The factory specifies the
storage backend as well. From this point on, there are no differences in the
usage (except for supported features, that is).

    // see Bootstrapping for how to get the session.

    $rootNode = $session->getNode("/");
    $whitewashing = $rootNode->addNode("www-whitewashing-de");
    $session->save();

    $posts = $whitewashing->addNode("posts");
    $session->save();

    $post = $posts->addNode("welcome-to-blog");
    $post->addMixin("mix:title");
    $post->setProperty("jcr:title", "Welcome to my Blog!");
    $post->setProperty("jcr:description", "This is the first post on my blog! Do you like it?");

    $session->save();

for a more detailed tutorial on how to use the PHPCR API.


# Implementation notes

See (doc/architecture.md) for an introduction how Jackalope is built. Have a
look at the source files and generate the phpdoc.


# TODO

The best overview of what needs to be done are the functional test failures and
skipped tests. Have a look at tests/inc/DoctrineDBALImplementationLoader.php
resp. tests/inc/JackrabbitImplementationLoader.php to see what is currently not
working and start hacking :-)

## Some Doctrine DBAL notes

* Implement moving nodes, DoctrineTransport::modeNode() (and make sure not to violate any constraints during the process)
* Implement usage of NodeTypeDefintions to read/write validation and formatting data correctly (such as auto-creating values, forcing multi-values)
* Implement storage of custom/user-defined NodeTypeDefinitions and such into the database.
* Versioning support
* Refactor storage to implement one one table per database type?
* Optimize database storage more, using real ids and normalizing the uuids and paths?
* Implement parser for JCR-SQL2 and implement it in DoctrineTransport::querySQL().
* Implement parser for Jackrabbit CND syntax for node-type definitions.
