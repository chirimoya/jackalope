# Architecture

Components

* PHPCR API Interfaces - defining the API
* API Tests - testing conformity of the implementation to the PHPCR API
* Jackalope
  * Storage independent layer
  * Storage layer


## PHPCR API Interfaces


These interfaces have to be implemented by all projects providing the API in
PHP. These interface definitions are adapted from the Java Content Repository
JCR standard. The API is implementation-independent and improved in cooperation
with all implementors of PHPCR and the JCR community.

PHP code: https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr

Documentation: https://phpcr.github.com/


## PHPCR API Tests


A suite of functional tests for testing if your implementation is correctly
following the specification. Have a look at the README in the git repository
to see how to set the tests up.

## Storage independent layer

This layer implements the PHPCR interfaces in pure, framework-agnostic PHP
without dependencies on any third-party libraries. It provides all the
necessary code for a PHPCR library without the data storage layer.

This mechanism, similar to Jackrabbit's [SPI](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jackrabbit-spi.html),
allows for easy adaptation to different storage backends, handling
implementation details such as transport layers not covered by the PHPCR
standard.

See the README files in the main folder for how to set up the project.

In the src folder, you find mainly classes with the names as defined by the
PHPCR API. The two important classes not defined by the API are the
``ObjectManager`` and ``Transport``.

* ObjectManager caches nodes and talks to Transport. For write operations, it
   acts as "Unit of Work" handler.
* Transport is separated from the implementation by Interfaces (see below)

Please read the phpdoc comments for implementation details. Note that the
methods implementing PHPCR interfaces are documented there. Generate the html
documentation according to doc/config/README to have a combined doc of the API
and implementation details.

## Storage layers: The transport interfaces

The storage layer is separated from the Jackalope application code by
interfaces. These interfaces define the basic operations needed to implement
the PHPCR operations. Implementing PHPCR support for a new storage engine is
easiest done by just implementing a new transport.

### DoctrineDBAL: All SQL databases supported by doctrine

The doctrine transport uses the doctrine database abstraction layer to talk to
any SQL database supported by doctrine.

PHP code: http://github.com/jackalope/jackalope (see Transport folder)

The code for the Doctrine transport is located in:

    src/Jackalope/Transport/Doctrine/DoctrineTransport.php
    src/Jackalope/Transport/Doctrine/RepositorySchema.php

The first file contains all the relevant transport code, the second the doctrine schema that is required to run this.


### Jackrabbit: WebDAV/davex protocol to talk to Jackrabbit

The jackrabbit transport stores data into an Apache Jackrabbit server using
a pure PHP implementation of the WebDAV/davex remoting protocol.

PHP code: http://github.com/jackalope/jackalope (see Transport folder)


To hack on Jackalope, you might want to read the documentation of the protocol used between Jackalope and the Jackrabbit backend. We have 2 files to download:
